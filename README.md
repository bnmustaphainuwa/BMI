A program to calculate the BMI (Body Mass Index)
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of health based on height and weight. It can be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing it by the square of your height in meters. 
The interpretation of BMI for people 20 years or older is as follows:
BMI                            INTERPRETATION

25.0 <= bmi <= 30.0             Overweight
30.0 <= bmi                     obese
